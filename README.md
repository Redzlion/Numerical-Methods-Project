Numerical Methods Project about Double Integral Numerical Calculation
Given a double integral over a rectangular domain [a,b]×[c,d] 𝑎 𝑏 ∫ 𝑐 𝑑 ∫ 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦)𝑑𝑦 𝑑𝑥 We should compute the solution with a composite 2-point Gauss-Legendre rule with respect to x and the 3-point Gauss-Legendre rule with respect to y
